# Full gulp pipeline build.
Full gulp pipeline build, for developers.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.  


## Prerequisites
What dependencies you need to install the software and how to install them as followed

1. **Npm** - npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and makes it easy to update the code that youâ€™re sharing, so you can build amazing things.
   - Learn more : https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

2. **gulp** - gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.
   - Learn more : https://gulpjs.com/ 


3. **Homebrew** - Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local.
   - Learn more - https://brew.sh

* Recommended install with **brew**.
   - past the following into your Terminal  
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

**Install nodeJS & npm with brew** : past the following into your terminal
```
$ brew install node
```
* After install is complete check install using the following in your terminal.  
For **node** - ```node -v``` this will print out a version number like this ```v10.6.0```.  
Now do the same for **npm** as followed ```npm -v``` output will look something like this ```6.2.0```.
